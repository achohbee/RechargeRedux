# Recharge Redux

This mod makes Spray Paint and TZP-Inhalent items rechargeable. The battery indicator will
properly display the percentage of the object available to use.

Configuration settings can be used to enable one or the other, by default both are enabled.
Config changes made mid-game (such as via the [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) mod) will take effect immediately.
